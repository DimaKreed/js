    <p>Diamondhead's body is composed of extremely thick organic green crystals. He has the ability to manipulate the atomic structure of his physiology at will, allowing him to form his limbs into diamond weapons such as blades and bludgeons. Moreover, he can control all the crystals he generates. He can fire crystal shards sequentially out of his hands and can explode his body parts into crystalline formations,[3] as well as make crystal constructs grow from his body, the latter of which he used to protect Gwen from a falling tree by making large crystalline spikes appear on his back and then disappear.</p>

        <p>
            Being one of Ben's most versatile alien forms, Heatblast is a pyrokinetic, meaning he has the ability to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form fire into any shape that he chooses, commonly fireballs. He can also enhance the fire in his hands for flaming punches,[2] and can breathe fire like a dragon.[1] To top it all off, he can even absorb heat and fire at the same time.[3][4] This means he can put out a fire faster than he can start one.

    <div id="Upgrade" class="left">
        <img src="../4/img/Upgrade_Model.png" alt="Upgrade">
        <p>Upgrade is not completely solid, as he can be both liquid and gelatinous. The nanites in his body are what allow Upgrade to reshape and move like liquid even though he's a solid being.[pop-up 2][1] Due to this, he can reshape himself to let projectiles or blows pass through him by creating a hole in his body at will. His physiology also makes him extremely flexible.</p>

    <div id="Wildmutt" class="right">
        <img src="../4/img/Wildmutt1.PNG.png" alt="Wildmutt">
        <p>Wildmutt's main ability is his sense of smell. As he has no eyes, his "vision" is made up of a dull 3D mapping of where his senses originate, similar to a thermograph. Combined with his enhanced hearing, his senses take the form of a radar or sonar, allowing him to still perceive his environment more clearly. His enhanced speed and reaction time allows him to dodge, evade, and counterattack effortlessly with the help of his senses.</p>
